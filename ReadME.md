In all of the places where you're supposed to fill your information you'll find HTML comments. As shown below just replace what is already in the opening and closing tags below the comment with your information.

```html
<div class="header__text-box row">
    <div class="header__text">
        <h1 class="heading-primary">
        <!-- Replace the following name with your name -->
        <span>Syed Ali Hussnain</span>
        </h1>
        <!-- Put a small paragraph about yourself -->
        <p>A Web Developer based in Lahore, Pakistan.</p>
        <a href="#contact" class="btn btn--pink">Get in touch</a>
    </div>
</div>
```

### Work Section

Each div with class `work__box` represents a project, replace the contents of the all the tags with the information of your projects.

```html
<div class="work__box">
    <div class="work__text">
    <h3>Portfolio Template</h3>
    <p>
        A free Open Source Portfolio for anyone to use for free.
    </p>
    <ul class="work__list">
        <li>HTML</li>
        <li>SCSS</li>
        <li>JavaScript</li>
        <li>Parcel</li>
    </ul>

    <div class="work__links">
        <a href="#" class="link__text">
        Visit Site <span>&rarr;</span>
        </a> 
        <a href="https://github.com/nisarhassan12/portfolio" target="_blank">
        <img src="./images/github.svg" class="work__code" alt="GitHub">
        </a>
    </div>
    </div>
    <div class="work__image-box">
        <img
            src="./images/project-1.png"
            class="work__image"
            alt="Project 1"
        />
    </div>
</div>
```

    class="work__image"
    alt="Project 1"
/>
```

### Clients Section

    src="./images/your-logo.png"
    class="client__logo"
    alt="Your Logo"
/>
```
